# Penlight

This folder was created running
```
luarocks install --tree lua_modules penlight
```
from the parent folder.

It is partly mirrored on GitHub, in particular the `lfs` module is filtered out by `.gitignore` because it is already included in `TeXLua`.

`AupLib.require` takes care of this particular setting.
